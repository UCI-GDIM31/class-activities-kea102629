## Devlogs
### W1
Hello world!
### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.
1. Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?
the r g b values are decimal values from 0-1.0 so they should be floats as ints are only whole numbers and strings are for text
2. Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?
_bounce is an int beacuse the number of bounces is a whole number. You cant have half a bounce so it cant be a float and its not text so it cant be a string. 
3. The error you got after Step X of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?
The error told me that I was missing a semicolon at the end of the line.
### W3
Tables 14-19
You’re building a horror game, and you’re writing a method named SetLightDimness that makes the room’s lights brighter or darker based on the player’s current sanity level. The player’s sanity level is a number that goes from 0% - 100%. The method changes the light itself, so it doesn’t need any output.

The input would be a float and there would be no output.
